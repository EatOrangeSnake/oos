An integrated C language on the operating system API module, absolutely useful for all module developers!
It contains apis for files and the operating system.Function and constant names are easy to understand, and I don't have to tell you that you all use them!
(Of course, we also have help documentation.)
I'm still maintaining this module, so it's not too much to support me!
